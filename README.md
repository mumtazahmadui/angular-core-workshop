# Angular Core Workshop

This workshop is about angular core features and was made with a help of NRWL extension, that give ability to streamline project development.

## The Stack

### Angular Material
Angular Material is a UI library for Angular that gives you access to a modern material UI that works across web, mobile, and desktop applications with minimal custom CSS and setup.

### JSON Server
Creates a quick and simple way to mock out a backend REST service. We can then deliver some mocked out data in JSON format to make sure everything is working as expected once our real backend is connected.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will both boot up a data server on localhost:3000 and serve the frontend on localhost:4200.
